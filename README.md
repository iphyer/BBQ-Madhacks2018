The bounding box quality checking web service for Madhacks 2018

## Introduction

This is the code repository for [Madhacks 2018](https://www.madhacks.io/). Madhacks is the University of Wisconsin's twice-annual hackathon, bringing together participants from all over the US and Canada for 24 hours of hacking.

BBQ standing bounding box qualifier which is a web service that examines the matching between ground truth bounding boxes and the predicted bounding boxes and produces a prediction quality report and debugging tools for object detection algorithm.

A lot of work of object detection methods are focusing on how to generate bounding box annotations but few have talked about how to debug or check where the object detection model fails. This hackathon project is a tool that can help people actually see where the object detection algorithm fails.
